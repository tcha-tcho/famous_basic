Join over 70,000 developers in our beta program at http://famo.us.

Famo.us is  a free opensource Javascript development platform that dan build apps, games and interfaces using HTML5 and WebGL.

What makes us unique is that we have built a pure JS renderer and 3D physics engine and we've wrapped those core engines with an enterprise grade platform that's easy to use.

Each week we release new examples.  If you are a blogger and would like early access so you can write about them conact Ryan@famo.us.

We are expecting to be in full public beta late February of 2014.
